This function reads the analog pin as shown below. Converts voltage signal
to a digital representation with analog to digital conversion. However, this is
done multiple times so that we can average it to eliminate measurement errors.
This averaged number is then used to calculate the resistance of the thermistor.
After this, the resistance is used to calculate the temperature of the
thermistor. Finally, the temperature is converted to celsius. Please refer to
the allaboutcircuits.com article for the specifics and general theory of this
process.
